<h1>Dad's Double Whole Grain Pancakes</h1>
<img src="../images/download-1.jpg">
<p>Did you know the pancake's shape and structure varies worldwide. In the United Kingdom, 
    pancakes are often unleavened and resemble a <em>crêpe</em>. 
    In North America, a leavening agent is used (typically baking powder) 
    creating a thick fluffy pancake. A <em>crêpe</em> is a thin Breton pancake of French origin 
    cooked on one or both sides in a special pan or crepe maker to achieve a lacelike network of 
    fine bubbles. A well-known variation originating from southeast Europe is a <em>palačinke</em>, a thin moist 
    pancake fried on both sides and filled with jam, cream cheese, chocolate, or ground walnuts, but many 
    other fillings—sweet or savoury—can also be used. My father's <strong>not so secret</strong> pancake recipe will knock you right out of your
    socks!
